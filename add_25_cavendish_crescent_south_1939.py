"""25 Cavendish Crescent South, 1939 - schedule 227.

Henry P Ritchie, estate manager, his wife Kathleen A, a widow of 68 living on
private means, and two domestics both born in 1916. None of the five was in the
record.

**Schedule 227 is also used by the other 1939 book** - the RMGC enumerator gave
that number to 29 Newcastle Drive - so anything written by schedule number alone
must name the house as well.
