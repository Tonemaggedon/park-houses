"""Hope Drive, 1939 - two households off the RMGB book, and a street of gun workers.

Schedules 100 and 101. Between them they hold five men building guns and
aeroplanes six days after the register was taken: three engineers at the gun
factory, an aero engine rigger, a fitter and a travelling inspector of
armaments. Hope Drive had a single round in the record before this.
