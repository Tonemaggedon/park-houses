"""7 Hamilton Drive, 1939 - a boarding house of eight, and a woman put back in it.

The page settles what two schedule 83s had left in doubt. **The run is ED letter
code RMGB**, a second book covering Hamilton Drive, and its schedule 83 is **7
Hamilton Drive** - so it is not the RMGC schedule 83 at Ribble Lodge at all.

**Muriel Langtree belongs here**, not at Ribble Lodge, where she had been posted
from an index on the strength of a schedule number that belongs to the other
book. Her birth year stands: the page reads 7 March 1918, and she is 21.

The household is A. Hagues's reading; the house and the district are read off
the page header and the address column.
